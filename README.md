Type Frenzy

A typing game inspired by osu by allowing players to optionally select game modifiers to increase difficulty and score.

- Type and match the prompted words on the screen.
- Lives are shown at the top left of the screen and are lost when submitting an incorrect word.
- There is a typing meter at the bottom that depletes overtime but resets after every correct input.
- Game modifiers can be selected before you start the game which can increase your combo multiplier with a return of a higher score calculation.

Game Modifier Options:
- Double Time: The typing countdown meter is twice as fast. Type the current word quickly before the timer runs out. Combo Multiplier Value: 1.25x
- Hidden: The current queued text will not be displayed. Remember that word before it comes into queue. Combo Multiplier Value: 1.15x
- Perfect: One life. Submit an incorrect word, it is game over! Ensure that your input is correct before submitting. Combo Multiplier Value: 1.10x
