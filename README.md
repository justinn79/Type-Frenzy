Tipitype Game

IDEA:
- Typing game where the player is prompted with words to type out
- Each time the player misclicks a wrong letter, they lose a life point
- There is a timer meter in the bottom that resets after every word is typed out completely (if this meter goes down all the way, it is game over)

FUTURE ADD ONS:
- Calculating score
- Game modifiers (making the game harder to increase score/difficulty)
    - Hidden (makes the word invisible)
    - Double Time (timer meter has a faster depletion)
